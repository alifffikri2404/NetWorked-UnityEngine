## Project Background
NetWorked! is an innovative e-learning application designed to educate computer science students about the foundation or basic of network syllabus, with a specific focus on the five layers of the TCP/IP model. NetWorked! seeks to improve learning outcomes by improving student engagement, motivation and retention through the use of interactive game design elements and gamification approaches. The application contains four separate levels, each of which focuses on one of the five TCP/IP layers, including topics covering the Physical and Data Link layers, Network layer, Transport layer, and Application layer. NetWorked! offers a more immersive and engaging learning experience with its dynamic and effective approach to network education.
